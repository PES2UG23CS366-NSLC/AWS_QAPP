So today’s discussion started a bit late because half the team joined late.
We spoke first about the Alpha project status, and there was some confusion
around who is doing what. John mentioned casually that he will probably
finish the report by Friday if there are no more changes from management,
but this was not clearly decided earlier.

There was a long discussion around UI issues. The design team should take
another look at the mockups before the next sprint starts because some
stakeholders were not happy with the current version. No final deadline
was fixed, but it needs attention soon.

HR also joined midway and said something about onboarding. Apparently the
onboarding documentation is outdated, and HR must update it for new hires,
especially since more interns are joining next month.

At some point, someone suggested that we need to schedule another meeting
next week just to clear the confusion around deliverables. No one objected,
so a follow-up meeting needs to be scheduled sometime next week.

Marketing talked for a while about Q2 campaigns, budgets, and social media,
but nothing actionable came out of that discussion today.

Before wrapping up, there was a reminder that if anyone notices missing
details in the report, they should inform John as soon as possible.
